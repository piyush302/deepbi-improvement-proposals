### Key Points at a Glance:

2. **LinkedIn:** CEO has 10K followers, company has only 1K — 10x gap to leverage
3. **Content:** YouTube (no presence), Medium (last post 2019), Dev.to & Twitter (no presence)
4. **Leads:** Monitor Druid Slack/GitHub (stargazers, watchers, complex issues) for potential customers
5. **Target:** Track companies posting Druid job openings and organizations with large-scale data engineering teams
6. **Website:** Development URLs in production, spelling errors on pricing page — quick fixes needed

## 1. SEO & Search Visibility

### Current State:
- **Deep.BI ranks approximately #39 when searching "Apache Druid"**
- This is a significant missed opportunity given your expertise

### Why This Is Critical:

**Nobody goes to page 2 of Google.**

- 75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results
- The top 3 results get ~55% of all clicks
- Position #10 gets ~2.5% of clicks; Position #39 gets virtually nothing
- If you're not in the top 10, you're invisible to potential customers

### SEO Strategy:

**Technical Blog Content (Long-tail keywords):**
- "How to reduce Apache Druid costs by 30%"
- "Apache Druid vs Clickhouse: Cost comparison"
- "Druid cluster sizing guide for cost optimization"
- "Apache Druid performance tuning best practices"

**Case Studies (Build authority):**
- "How [Company] saved $1M on Druid infrastructure"
- "From 10s to 100ms: A Druid performance case study"

**Backlink Strategy:**

- Contributions to Apache Druid documentation
- Mentions in industry publications

## 2. Social Media & Content Presence - Major Opportunity

### Current State Analysis:

| YouTube | Almost no presence | - | HIGH |
| Medium | Last post: 2019 | - | HIGH |
| Dev.to | No presence | - | MEDIUM |
| Twitter/X | No posts yet | - | MEDIUM |

**Key Insight:** The CEO has 10x more followers than the company. This personal brand can be leveraged to grow the company presence.

## 3. Lead Generation & Community Engagement

### Target Identification:

- Monitor GitHub for Druid-related activity and contributors

- Identify organizations with data engineering teams at scale
- Generate leads by identifying companies working with large datasets

### Community Engagement (Builds Credibility + Leads):

**Apache Druid Slack:**
- Answer troubleshooting questions
- **Update your profile:** Make sure your Slack profile shows Deep.BI - when you help someone, they'll see your company and remember who helped them
- Share optimization tips
- Build reputation as the go-to experts
- **Identify organizations:** Look at who's posting troubleshooting questions - check their company/email domain to identify potential leads
- Companies asking complex questions = companies with real Druid deployments = potential customers

**GitHub:**
- **Monitor Druid stargazers and watchers:** People starring or watching the repo are evaluating or actively using Druid
- **Watch the Issues section:** Look for advanced/complex issues - these indicate companies with serious deployments who may need expert help
- Contribute to Druid issues and discussions
- Open-source useful tools
- Showcase technical expertise

### Educational Content for Lead Generation:

## 4. Website & Professionalism

### Website Quality Issues Identified

During my audit, I found several issues that may impact credibility:

**Critical Issues:**
- Development URLs (deepbi-www.azurewebsites.net) appearing in production pages
- Spelling errors on the pricing page ("runnign", "anda .")
- Inconsistent design themes across pages
- Missing footers on some pages
- Layout shifts on button hover

**Recommendations:**
- Fix all content errors (estimated 2-4 hours of work)
- Standardize design consistency across all pages
- Add clear case studies with metrics (cost savings, performance gains)
- Include customer testimonials and logos
